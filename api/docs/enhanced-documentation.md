# Agent Forge API Documentation

## Overview

Agent Forge is an AI-powered workflow automation platform that generates workflow state JSON objects from database records. The system reads from `workflow_rows` and `workflow_blocks_rows` tables and produces Agent Forge-compatible state objects with blocks, edges, and metadata.

## Base URL

```
https://solidus-olive.vercel.app
```

## Authentication

Most endpoints in the Agent Forge API are publicly accessible for demonstration purposes. However, for production use:

### API Keys

For enhanced security and access to premium features, you can use API keys:

```bash
# Set your API key as an environment variable
export AGENT_FORGE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Use in requests
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_FORGE_API_KEY" \
  https://solidus-olive.vercel.app/api/endpoint
```

### Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage:
- Anonymous users: 100 requests per hour
- Authenticated users: 1000 requests per hour

## SDKs and Libraries

Official libraries are available for popular programming languages:
- **Python**: `pip install agent-forge-sdk`
- **JavaScript**: `npm install agent-forge-js`
- **Java**: `com.agentforge:agent-forge-java`

## Data Flow

### Input
Query `workflow_blocks_rows` joined with `workflow_rows`

### Generation
Map to state JSON structure:
- `workflow_blocks_rows.id` â†’ `blocks.id`
- `position_x/y` â†’ `position.x/y`

### Persistence
Write state JSON to `public.workflow.state`

## ID Matching Example

- Workflow "wf1" in `workflow_rows.id` links to blocks where `workflow_id = "wf1"`
- Block "b2" with `parent_id = "b1"` indicates hierarchy within same workflow

## Success Criteria

- API documentation is comprehensive and pushed to Git
- Database relationships are properly defined with FKs and indexes
- 50+ synthetic entries created in guideline tables
- Production tables populated with corresponding data
- All changes committed and pushed to repository
